#  Music Playlist Recommendation Engine

---

### Problem Statement

The goal is to improve upon the Spotify curated playlists by creating a recommendation engine that would extend playlists, taking into account user preferences across several dimensions: playlists, artists and song meta data. 

As a secondary deliverable, I'd like to develop a web application within Slack that would take a user_id, playlist, discover/popular preference, and provide a list of recommended tuneskies.
